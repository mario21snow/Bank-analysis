# Bank-analysis
This Power BI dashboard is designed to provide a comprehensive analysis of a bank dataset,
leveraging the capabilities of Microsoft Power BI. It offers a deep dive into the data, using
various visualizations and interactive features to uncover valuable insights that can inform
decision-making in a business context.
Key Objectives of the Dashboard:
1. Balance by Age and Gender: This visualization allows us to understand the distribution
of account balances based on both age and gender, providing insights into the financial
demographics of our customer base.
2. Number of Customers by Age and Gender: Here, we explore the count of customers
categorized by age groups and gender, giving us a clear demographic overview.
3. Number of Customers by Region: Understanding the geographical distribution of
customers is essential. This visualization breaks down customer counts by region.
4. Balance by Region: Building on the regional insights, we examine the distribution of
account balances across different regions.
5. Number of Customers by Job Type: This visualization sheds light on the occupationbased segmentation of our customer base.
6. Balance by Gender: A focused view on account balances, specifically dissecting the
gender divide among our customers.
7. Total Customers Joined: Tracking the total number of customers who have joined over
time helps in monitoring customer acquisition.
8. Cards:
• Max Balance by Age: Identifying the age group with the highest maximum
account balance.
• Min Balance by Age: Identifying the age group with the lowest minimum account
balance.
• Max Customers by Gender: Determining the gender category with the maximum
number of customers.
Throughout this project, I have not only explored these objectives but also delved into the art of
data cleaning, transformation, and visualization within the Power BI environment. The skills
acquired in this endeavor can be applied to various domains and industries, making data-driven
decision-making more accessible and impactful.
